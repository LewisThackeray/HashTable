This repository contains two different implementations of a Hash Table: one uses Chaining as the Conflict Resolution Technique and the other implementation uses Open Addressing.  The different implementations are stored on different branches within the repository - you are currently on the **chaining** branch.  To look at the code for the **Open Addressing** implementation, please switch branches.
