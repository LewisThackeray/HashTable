This repository contains the source code for implementing a hash table in C.  I chose to create two implementations that are stored in different branches: one implementation where chaining is used as the conflict resolution technique and another implementation where open addresses is used as the conflict resolution technique.

I am aware that I could have used a more optimal approach for this project like using Java and an object-oriented approach, however, I wanted to challenge myself by using the procedural paradigm.
